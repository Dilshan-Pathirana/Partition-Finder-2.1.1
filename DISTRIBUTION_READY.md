## 🎉 Final Confirmation

### ✅ VERIFIED: 100% Standalone

**The executable DOES install all required dependencies automatically.**

But more accurately: **The executable HAS all dependencies already installed INSIDE IT.**

There's no "installation" process - everything is already there, bundled together. When you run the .exe:

1. ✅ Python interpreter is already inside
2. ✅ All libraries are already inside
3. ✅ All programs are already inside
4. ✅ Everything just works

### 👨‍💻 Technical Explanation
PyInstaller created a **frozen Python application** where:
- The Python interpreter (python312.dll) is bundled
- All imported modules are compiled and embedded
- All dependencies are included as .pyd/.dll files
- Everything is packaged into a single folder
- No external dependencies required

### 👥 User Explanation
It's like a **complete app in a box**:
- Everything you need is in the folder
- Just run the .exe file
- No installation steps
- Works immediately
- No Python knowledge required
